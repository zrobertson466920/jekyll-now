I am a first-year CS PhD student at The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My undergraduate major was Computational and Applied Mathematics at University of Chicago. My main research focus at the moment is reinforcement learning. I'm interested in imitation learning and evolutionary methods as well.
